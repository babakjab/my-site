    <h1>Azerbaijani, French, and Persian: An Open Philosophical Comparison</h1>



    <p>In this surfing mind, as I burn with thought and wander through the writings of the great philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, I write down this concept: Do not simply say “human,”  say “the existing human.”</p>



    <p>Yes—the existing human sketches an image in the mind from the things they perceive; while understanding. Over time, as one reflects, this figure becomes a picture within. This process of procedure is realized through the intuition within the mind and the logicun that emerges from language. Friends, I do not say “logic” in the narrow sense, but “logicun”—because it carries a deeper meaning. Logic can be rigid, but alongside this rigidity exists wonder—the sudden awe that arises from unexpected realization.</p>



    <p>Earlier, I wrote “while understanding,” not “when understood.” While understanding, a human still possesses their own thought; but when understood, they are already trapped within another thought’s cage.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <h2>Azerbaijani and French: Shared Strengths, Different Completenesses</h2>



    <p>Azerbaijani and French share something remarkable: they both possess a full temporal system of tenses. Each has some that the other lacks, but together they mirror each other — a balance of differences. Both use front and back vowels, enabling them to rise from uncertainty toward proof. This is especially visible in philosophical thought, where precision and clarity matter most. Persian, by contrast, stands outside this completeness.</p>



    <p>Both Azerbaijani and French also share a firmness of meaning in words. A word may have shades, but these shades are tied together by grammar and structure. This firmness is why both languages can sustain philosophical writing: their words stabilize concepts instead of drowning them in ambiguity.</p>



    <p>Azerbaijani, however, has an added dimension. Its words are not only logical; they draw upon inner vision — what I call görənti. A word does not simply point; it resonates with an image of truth inside the mind.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <h2>Persian: The Weight of Ambiguity</h2>



    <p>Persian, in contrast, suffers under semantic disconnection. Words often carry multiple meanings that are not connected by inner relation.</p>



    <p>Take the Persian word کاوش (kavosh). It means both “journey/exploration” and “discovery.” These two senses are not organically related. Compare this with polysemy in Azerbaijani or French, where different meanings of a word are tied to a single conceptual root. In Persian, meanings can float apart. This is why Persian philosophy often dissolves into poetry — not in the constructive sense, but in a sense where truth disappears into ambiguity. Ancient Persian philosophy, as in Omar Khayyam, remains at the level of surface imagery rather than conceptual depth.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <h2>Poetry as Proof</h2>



    <p>Consider these verses said by me:</p>



    <p><strong>In Azerbaijani:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>“Mafhumlarla alışarkən<br>

      Zehnimdə səyahət edərkən<br>

      Həqiqətin işığını gördüm—<br>

      İlahi, nə gözəl!<br>

      Nə dərin­dir bu tapıntı—bu məna!”</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>While lighting with concepts<br>

      While journeying in my mind<br>

      I saw the light of truth—<br>

      Oh God, how beautiful!<br>

      How deep is this discovery — the meaning!</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p>Here the word tapıntı (discovery) is precise. There is no doubt whether it is a journey or a finding — the grammar and structure force the clarity.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <p><strong>In Persian:</strong></p>

    <blockquote class="rtl" lang="fa">

      <p>غرق در مفاهیم<br>

      کاوش‌کنان در ذهنم<br>

      نور حقیقت را دیدم خدایا، چه زیبا!<br>

      چه عمیق است این کاوش در معنا!</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>Drowning in concepts<br>

      Discovering (or journeying) within my mind<br>

      I saw the light of truth — <br>

      Oh God, how beautiful!<br>

      How deep is this discovery (journey?) into meaning!</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p>And here lies the problem: does کاوش mean the act of traveling or the act of finding? The ambiguity cannot be resolved within the language itself. Persian here leaves the poet in doubt — the meaning never fixes.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <h2>The Word Bütün</h2>



    <p>Now look at the precision of Azerbaijani again in this line of Imadaddin Nasimi:</p>



    <blockquote>

      <p>“Aləmdə bu gün əhdi bütün yar ələ girməz”</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p><strong>Translation:</strong><br>

    Yes—in this world, the one who keeps his word honest and light-hearted always lives free.</p>



    <p>The word bütün in Azerbaijani can mean “whole,” “truthful,” “entire,” “complete.” But here, in this verse, it can only mean honest. The structure of the language fixes the meaning firmly. That is the power of Azerbaijani: multivalence in the dictionary, precision in the poem.</p>



    <p>Contrast with Hafiz of Shiraz:</p>



    <blockquote class="rtl" lang="fa">

      <p>“ز دست بخت گران خواب و کار بی‌سامان”</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p>The word گران (geran) may mean “heavy,” “difficult,” “precious,” “noble,” even “lonely.” But which one is intended? The ambiguity never resolves. The result is not proof, but confusion.</p>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>



    <h2>Mugham and Dastgah: The Musical Root</h2>



    <p>Why does Azerbaijani allow this intuition? Because its language is rooted in mugham, the traditional musical system. In Azerbaijani mugham, the mind simultaneously dances, laughs, cries, ascends, and sees. From this emerges a true inner order: thesis, antithesis, synthesis. The inner vision — is the synthesis itself.</p>



    <p>Here, the mind moves through both fixed and shifting states. It awakens not despair but a current of optimism. In Persian mugham, this dimension is absent. There is ‘play,’ yes — but it is mere dance. And in that dance you are no longer a true human being, only a toy. Dance becomes nothing more than a hollow lament of separation.</p>



    <p>One may say that the dasgah system — a large modal system, composed of many sections — in Persian mugham is similar in form to Azerbaijani mugham. But my answer is : not in spirit. In Azerbaijani mugham, each guşə resonates with the spirit of the land and language; it dances, laughs, cries, rises to the heights, and truly sees. In Persian dastgah, there is movement, yes—but it is only dance. And in that dance, you are no longer the existing human; you become a puppet. It is only a hollow sorrow.</p>



    <p>That is why Azerbaijani mugham sustains thought, while Persian mugham tends toward decorative melancholy.</p>



    <p class="note">Note that each dastgah is made up of several sections (shobe / şöbə) and guşəs. A guşə is like a smaller melodic stop or station inside the larger system. Sometimes a single guşə is so rich that it can be performed almost like an independent mugham.</p>



    <p>Here is my own call back to Hafez:</p>



    <p><strong>Azerbaijani (original):</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>Bu dünyada nələr gəldi, nələr getdi<br>

      Nələr qaldı dahilərdən?<br>

      Aldatdılar xalqı eli, xıl etdilər ay onları.<br>

      Işıq gəlib getdi oldu… ay da nə bir seçməz oldu.<br>

      Yuxulatdılar seçməzləri, saxladılar axayları.</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p><strong>English translation:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>In this world, what has come, what has gone?<br>

      What remains from the great ones?<br>

      They deceived the people, scattered them like dust.<br>

      Light came and went… the moon too lost its clarity.<br>

      They lulled the pure ones to sleep, and preserved only the shallow.</p>

    </blockquote>



    <p class="sep">⸻</p>

<h2>Persian: Ambiguity as Surface Art</h2>



<p>So we conclude that Persian is not the language of philosophy, since philosophy requires precision, while Persian sinks into ambiguity. But then another question arises: is Persian the language of art?</p>



<p><strong>Yes — but with limits.</strong> There are two kinds of art.</p>



<p><em>The first kind</em> touches only the surface of concepts. Let us call it <strong>the image</strong>. This kind of art raises questions but does not deepen them; it remains suspended on the surface. Persian excels in this type of art, leaving the audience with many questions — beautiful, but unresolved.</p>



<p><em>The second kind of art</em> is different. It is still ambiguous, but it moves straight into depth. To reach this kind of art, one must use the <strong>structure of language</strong> itself, arranging words carefully, step by step, to descend into concepts. This is harder to achieve. Persian cannot do this, because its weak structure does not sustain conceptual descent.</p>



<p>In Persian, ambiguity is achieved too easily: by using words with multiple unrelated meanings, without grounding them in grammar or structure. The result is beauty without depth. This is why many lazy Azerbaijani poets preferred writing in Persian — ambiguity in Persian requires little effort.</p>



<p>But to create ambiguity in Azerbaijani or French is a far greater challenge. There, one must <em>play with the structure of language itself</em>. Only then can ambiguity open the way from image to depth, from surface to concept. And precisely because of this demand, Azerbaijani and French can produce art that is not only beautiful, but profound.</p>


<p class="sep">⸻</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>



    <p>French and Azerbaijani, though from different families, meet in their structural precision — each balancing the other’s tenses, each using vowels to oscillate between doubt and proof, each stabilizing thought. Azerbaijani surpasses, however, because its words draw on görənti, inner vision, rooted in music and culture.</p>



    <p>Persian, meanwhile, falters. Its polysemy slips into unrelated meanings, its poetry collapses into irresolvable ambiguity. It can charm, but it cannot prove.</p>



    <p>And so the existing human — the one who lives within language — finds in Azerbaijani not just words, but vision; not just sentences, but light.</p>



    <p>In sum:<br>

    • Azerbaijani and French stand side by side, each with a system of tenses and firm word meanings.<br>

    • Persian, by contrast, suffers from double meanings without structural grounding.<br>

    • In poetry, Azerbaijani words lock into clarity, while Persian words drift into confusion.<br>

    • In music, Azerbaijani guşələr embody truth through vision, while Persian ones dissolve into empty play.</p>



    <p>Philosophy lives where language secures meaning. Azerbaijani, like French, belongs to this world. Persian, for all its beauty, struggles in the shadows of ambiguity.</p>
