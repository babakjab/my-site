    <h1>Persian Between Power and Borrowed Structures: Ferdowsi, Arabic Influence, and the Question of Clarity</h1>



    <p>Persian is often celebrated as a language preserved by Ferdowsi and elevated by later poets. But a truthful look tells a different story. Ferdowsi’s <em>Shahnameh</em> is a monument of epic narrative, yet it did not prove that Persian could carry every domain of thought. His language remained powerful only in fields where Persian was already strong: history, blood, kingship, morality in action, and the cycles of fate. He stayed within the heroic and narrative zones. Concepts such as faith, loyalty, or the inner life were never tested in their deeper sides. The clarity we find in Ferdowsi is real, but conditional — it is the clarity of a language that avoided its weakest zones.</p>



    <p>This limitation was not an accident of one poet. It reflects a longer history. Pre-Islamic Persian, from Achaemenid to Sassanid times, was a language of empire: inscriptions, decrees, proclamations of conquest, the law of kings. It was a language of power, not of philosophy. The scattered Middle Persian (Pahlavi) texts that survive — religious Zoroastrian writings and fragments of wisdom literature — are small in scope compared to the vast philosophical traditions of Greek, Sanskrit, or later Arabic. Nationalist claims about great Persian libraries burned by Arabs collapse under scrutiny: if there had been a continuous body of deep conceptual writing, some of it would have survived among scholars. Its near-total absence is the proof. Persian before Islam did not cultivate structures for metaphysics, psychology, or abstract speculation.</p>



    <p>After Ferdowsi, the situation shifted but not through native invention. Later poets and thinkers entered domains Ferdowsi had left untouched — inner psychology, mysticism, philosophy — but they did so by importing Arabic structures. Arabic offered ready-made molds: patterns like <strong>fā&#702;il</strong> (doer: <strong>&#702;ālim</strong> “knower”), <strong>maf&#702;ūl</strong> (object: <strong>ma&#702;lūm</strong> “known”), <strong>mafā&#702;il</strong> (plural: <strong>&#702;ajā&#702;ib</strong> “wonders”), along with abstract endings like <strong>-at</strong> (<strong>ḥaqīqat</strong> “truth,” <strong>ma&#702;rifat</strong> “gnosis,” <strong>&#702;ibādat</strong> “worship”) and <strong>-iyyat</strong> (<strong>insāniyyat</strong> “humanity”). Persian adopted these not just as foreign words, but as <em>structural habits</em>. Instead of deepening its own resources (<strong>-ī, -gī, -mand</strong>), it leaned on these imported molds. Instead of expanding concepts through compounding, it relied on abstractions built in Arabic patterns.</p>



    <p>This gave Persian a new expressive range, but at a price. Ferdowsi’s Persian was direct because it avoided fragile domains. Later Persian seemed profound because it borrowed the sound of profundity from Arabic molds. The result was brilliance mixed with illusion: a language of dazzling poetry, but structurally hybrid, dependent on foreign frameworks for its abstractions.</p>



    <p>Azerbaijani, by contrast, shows another path. Like other Turkic languages, it borrowed words but resisted structural borrowing. It stayed agglutinative, forming its own abstractions: <strong>doğruluq</strong> (truth), <strong>yanlışlıq</strong> (falsehood), <strong>yaxşılıq</strong> (goodness), <strong>pislik</strong> (evil). Even foreign roots were absorbed into Turkic grammar, not raised into alien molds. Its clarity remains intact because its structure remained its own.</p>



    <p class="sc">The principle is simple and unforgiving:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>A language may borrow words.</li>

      <li>But a language that borrows structures risks losing its own conceptual engine.</li>

    </ul>



    <p>Persian before Arabs had power but not conceptual depth. Ferdowsi preserved what it had, but did not prove more. After him, Persian stepped into philosophy and mysticism not by creating new structures, but by borrowing Arabic ones. That history leaves Persian as a brilliant but mixed language — clear in its epics, ambiguous in its abstractions. Azerbaijani, by holding to its own structures, retains the path Persian abandoned: a language that can grow its depth without illusion.</p>



    <blockquote class="punchline">A language that rules by power but thinks with borrowed molds may sing beautifully, yet it never speaks with its own soul.</blockquote>



    <h2 class="reflective-note">Reflective Note</h2>

    <p class="reflective-note">What began as a question about Ferdowsi opened into something larger. By tracing where he was clear and where he remained silent, we uncovered the deeper history of Persian itself. The language that once stood strong in epic narrative proved limited in abstraction; the empire that claimed wisdom left little conceptual writing behind; and the tradition that followed reached new depths only by borrowing foreign molds. What seemed at first like a heroic preservation becomes, on closer view, a history of structural dependence. In this contrast, the truth of Persian is revealed — not only in its brilliance, but also in the paths it never built for itself.</p>
