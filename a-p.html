      <p><em>I’m not biased against any language—my stance is about the <strong>structure</strong> and the <strong>thinking patterns</strong> a language carries with it.</em>

      In Iran, Persian has been imposed as the official language, but its structural shallowness has distanced us from <strong>deep thought</strong>, turning even suffering into a polished surface detached from real human experience. It satisfies the ear but blinds the mind to depth.</p>



  <p>

    Take a simple phrase: <em>man miravam</em> (“I am going”). On the surface, it sounds natural, 

    but structurally it is too smooth. The prefix <em>mi-</em> blurs between habitual action and present 

    continuity. It can mean “I usually go” or “I’m going now,” without forcing a distinction. 

    The verb slides, polished, but it does not anchor itself in lived time.

  </p>



  <p>

    Compare this with Azerbaijani: <strong>Mən gedirəm</strong>. The <em>-irəm</em> form locks the action 

    into the present, into continuity—it is happening now. In English: <strong>I am going</strong>—again, 

    aspect and auxiliary mark the process as unfolding in the present. In French: <strong>Je vais</strong>—

    a sense of direction, a motion already underway. But in Persian, <em>man miravam</em> floats: elegant 

    yet shallow, detached from suffering, detached from the embodied depth of action.

  </p>



  <p>

    This is not only style; it is structure. And structure shapes thought.

  </p>



  <p>

    But to be fair, this very smoothness that weakens Persian’s depth is also what makes it so powerful 

    in poetry. In Hafez or Saadi, the language flows like silk:

  </p>



  <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #aaa; padding-left: 12px; margin: 1em 0; font-style: italic;">

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; direction: rtl; text-align: right; font-family: 'Noto Naskh Arabic', serif;">

      بیا تا گل برافشانیم و می در ساغر اندازیم

    </p>

    <p>

      (<em>Biyā tā gol bar-afshānīm o mey dar sāghar andāzīm —<br>

      “Come, let us scatter flowers and pour wine into the cup.”</em>)

    </p>

  </blockquote>



  <p>

    The line glides effortlessly, its rhythm polished and musical. Persian’s structure favors elegance, 

    symmetry, and a seamless surface beauty. It does not demand existential weight; it offers lyrical harmony.

  </p>



  <p>

    By contrast, Azerbaijani — or French — often embraces rougher edges. In Azerbaijani, even an ordinary 

    question like <em>Sənə dəxli var?</em> carries a living tension that can be reshaped by particles 

    (<em>mi/mı</em>), bending thought into multiple dimensions. In French, <em>Je souffre</em> places suffering 

    as an embodied fact, pressing into life. Persian, however, turns suffering into a polished form — 

    less jagged, less embodied.

  </p>



  <p>

    Thus, Persian’s power is not in depth but in refinement. It chooses elegance over existential rawness. 

    My critique is not that Persian is incapable of beauty — it is that its structural beauty comes at the 

    cost of conceptual depth.

  </p>



      <p>If Persian were structurally deeper than Azerbaijani, I would not oppose it as Iran’s official language. But it is not. Azerbaijani, despite being neglected, contains many unexplored aspects—dimensions that could bring invaluable insights to humanity. Yet it remains suffocated under the weight of incompetent so‑called “scholars” who fail to uncover its richness.</p>



      <h2>A single sentence, multiple worlds (Azerbaijani focus)</h2>

      <p>In Azerbaijani, the focus particle <code>mi/mı</code> lets a single sentence open into multiple logical perspectives:</p>

      <ul>

        <li><code>Ali Makıya gedəcək?</code> — Will Ali go to Maku?</li>

        <li><code>Ali <em>mi</em> Makıya gedəcək?</code> — Is it <em>Ali</em> (and not someone else) who will go?</li>

        <li><code>Ali Makıya <em>mı</em> gedəcək?</code> — Is it <em>Maku</em> (and not somewhere else) that he will go to?</li>

        <li><code>Ali Makıya gedəcək <em>mi</em>?</code> — Will he, in fact, go to Maku?</li>

      </ul>



      <p>Now compare this to Persian:</p>

      <ul class="rtl" lang="fa">

        <li>«آیا علی به ماکو خواهد رفت؟»</li>

        <li>«علی به ماکو خواهد رفت؟»</li>

      </ul>



      <p>No matter how it is phrased, the depth collapses into one surface-level question. Persian smooths over the distinctions; Azerbaijani brings them alive. This difference is not just grammatical—it reflects how each language <strong>teaches us to see the world</strong>. Azerbaijani opens thought into dimensions; Persian closes it into a single flat plane.</p>



<h3>Another Example: Sənə dəxli var?</h3>

<p>

In Azerbaijani: <strong>Sənə dəxli var?</strong> — <em>Does it concern you?</em><br>

• <strong>Sənəmi dəxli var?</strong> — Is it <em>you</em> it concerns?<br>

• <strong>Sənə dəxl<i>imi</i> var?</strong> — Is it the <em>concern itself</em> that exists?<br>

• <strong>Sənə dəxli varmı?</strong> — Does it in fact concern you?

</p>



<p>

Here the particle <strong>mi/mı</strong> can attach to different words, shifting the <strong>focus</strong> each time. 

Every variation is grammatical and meaningful, and each opens a new logical perspective.

</p>



<p>

Now look at Persian: <strong>به تو ربط دارد؟</strong> (<em>Be to rabt dāre?</em>).<br>

• <strong>آیا به تو ربط دارد؟</strong> — Does it concern you? (general).<br>

• <strong>به تو آیا ربط دارد؟</strong> — awkward, nearly meaningless.<br>

• <strong>به تو ربط آیا دارد؟</strong> — ungrammatical.

</p>



<p>

Persian cannot replicate the layered shifts. Its marker <strong>آیا</strong> works only at the 

<strong>sentence level</strong>: it frames the whole clause as a question, but it cannot focus on different words. 

Azerbaijani’s <em>mi/mı</em> operates at the <strong>word level</strong>, creating depth; 

Persian’s <em>āyā</em> stays on the <strong>surface</strong>, flattening meaning.

</p>



<p>Persians may argue that they can fix the flexibility Azerbaijani offers in questions (such as <i>Ali Makıya gedəcək?</i> / <i>Ali mi Makıya gedəcək?</i>) by relying on forms like:</p>



<ul>

  <li><i>Āyā Ali be Maku khāhad raft?</i></li>

  <li><i>Ali āyā be Maku khāhad raft?</i></li>

  <li><i>Ali be Maku āyā khāhad raft?</i></li>

</ul>



<p>But this only works in certain cases. It fails when we look at examples like <i>Sənə dəxli var?</i> (“Is it your concern?”). 

In Azerbaijani, the placement of <i>mi</i> allows subtle shifts of emphasis across different words. 

Persian, however, relies on <i>āyā</i> at the beginning, which cannot be meaningfully inserted before each element. 

For instance, translating into Persian as <i>be to rabti dāre?</i>—adding <i>āyā</i> before <i>dāre</i> creates only an empty emphasis, 

not a structurally different question. This reveals Persian’s limits in depth of flexibility compared to Azerbaijani.</p>



      <p><em>Any language can stretch to express depth. But the question is: at what cost?</p></em>In Azerbaijani, depth is natural, flexible, woven into structure. In Persian, it is costly, forced, and often flattened. When a culture is made to think through a structure that smooths and polishes at the expense of depth, its thought becomes shallow. This, at its core, is why I resist Persian as Iran’s sole official language..</p>
