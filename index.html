  <p style="margin:0 0 8px;"><strong>Title of paper:</strong> <em>On the Implicit Equivalence of the Law of Excluded Middle and the Countable Axiom of Choice</em></p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 8px;"><strong>Author:</strong> Babak Jabbar Nezhad</p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 8px;"><strong>Uploaded to ResearchGate:</strong> Early March 2025</p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 8px;"><strong>Submitted to Journal of Symbolic Logic:</strong> March 13, 2025</p>
  <p style="margin:0 12px 16px 0;"><strong>Decision:</strong> Rejected April 2, 2025</p>

  <hr style="border:0;height:1px;background:#e6e6e6;margin:18px 0;">

  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:1.15rem;">Main Result</h3>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px;">
    In this paper, I proved several results relating the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM), the Countable Axiom of Choice (CAC),
    and related principles. Among them, the most significant theorem states:
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 12px;font-size:1.05rem;"><strong>CAC ‚áí LPO</strong>.</p>
  <p style="margin:0 0 16px;">
    This implication was first posed by me as a conjecture; in collaboration with an AI system, a concise proof was found,
    confirming the conjecture.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:1.15rem;">Context</h3>
  <ul style="margin:0 0 16px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      The theorem shows that CAC entails the Limited Principle of Omniscience (LPO), strengthening the structural
      connections between choice principles and constructive logic.
    </li>
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      The full paper was submitted to the <em>Journal of Symbolic Logic</em> on March 13, 2025 and rejected on April 2, 2025.
      The rejection of this paper was not on the grounds of AI involvement. Another paper submitted to a different journal
      was rejected explicitly citing AI collaboration.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px;font-size:1.15rem;">Significance</h3>
  <ul style="margin:0 0 16px 18px;padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      Illuminates how even limited forms of Choice carry substantial logical strength.
    </li>
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      Provides a new structural bridge between principles in constructive mathematics.
    </li>
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px;">
      Represents, to my knowledge, one of the earliest cases where an AI system contributed to proving an original
      theorem in mathematical logic prior to wider public demonstrations of AI doing new mathematics.

    ‚ú¶ A New Framework for Knowledge ‚ú¶

  </p>



  <p style="margin:0 0 14px;">

    These papers are not fragments of research. They are steps of a larger vision ‚Äî a framework that cuts across the old

    boundaries of disciplines. In mathematics and logic, in psychology and physics, in linguistics and philosophy, they

    reveal the same hidden structure: how local choices become global truths, how chaos folds into order, how the human

    mind and the universe share the same patterns.

  </p>



  <p style="margin:0 0 14px;">

    They were written outside the gates of institutions, against dismissal and silence. Yet from exile, they mark a

    beginning: a new way of seeing the foundations of knowledge. Not an addition to existing systems, but an alternative

    path ‚Äî one that unifies proof and poem, structure and experience, geometry and emotion.

  </p>



  <p style="margin:0 0 14px;">

    To read them is not only to follow results, but to witness how discovery can emerge where it was not supposed to

    exist. This is the manifesto of survival through thought: a claim that truth belongs not to academies, but to the

    human mind wherever it dares to see.

  <h3 style="margin:0 0 8px;">The Story Behind the Parallel Law of Excluded Middle (PLEM)</h3>

  <p style="margin:0 0 10px;">

    I built the counterexample to the Law of Excluded Middle ‚Äî the seed from which PLEM was born ‚Äî alone, in extreme isolation. At the time, I was living with severe heart failure: my left ventricular ejection fraction had fallen below 15%, and my heart was enlarged from inflammation. I worked in cycles ‚Äî pushing the mathematics until I could no longer breathe, resting for minutes, then returning to the page ‚Äî while my mother watched in fear.

  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 10px;">

    During the same period, my father was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs. With my damaged heart, I drove him four hours to Urmia in our broken car when he could barely move. While before, in Paris, I walked through the night for twelve hours at a time under relentless hostility, telling myself that even if it cost my life, I had a responsibility ‚Äî to humanity and to mathematics ‚Äî to finish.

  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 10px;">

    I did finish. Today, some platforms hide my posts or erase profiles; yet PLEM exists, written into the structure of logic. No algorithm or silence can erase that it was born in those moments between breaths, on streets where I walked with death in one hand and mathematics in the other.

    In philosophy and logic, stress is usually treated as a matter of tone. But in Azerbaijani, structures like

    <span class="az">h…ôm d…ô</span>, <span class="az">ya da</span> and <span class="az">n…ô d…ô</span> show that stress can be carried by

    <strong>grammar itself</strong>, not voice. This <em>structural stress</em> changes the logical weight of a

    statement even when the words are identical ‚Äî a distinction that <em>Frege</em> sensed but never developed.

<h2>üîç Critiques & Coined Words</h2>

<h3>The Story Behind the Word ‚ÄúDirtiot‚Äù</h3>

<p><em>(Dirty + Idiot ‚Äî but in silence, not insult)</em></p>



<p>A few months ago, I submitted my paper ‚ÄúExploring Azerbaijani Verb Conjugation: A Comparative Study with French and English‚Äù to the Journal of Turkic Languages, accompanied by a respectful letter explaining my comparative methodology and the paper‚Äôs focus on filling grammatical gaps in Azerbaijani through logic and systematization.</p>



<p>Less than 24 hours later, I received this response from Prof. Dr. Lars Johanson:</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúYour approach is personal as you point out. As such it has definitely a value for you, but it cannot be published in our journal‚Ä¶ I send you here a link to an article on the Maku dialect.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>He dismissed the core of the work‚Äîits comparative logic, grammatical contributions, and structural insights‚Äîreducing it to a personal reflection. I replied respectfully, clarifying that my paper was grounded in analytical reasoning, not anecdotal memory, and that the goal was to enrich linguistic theory, not merely reflect on dialects.</p>



<p>His final reply?</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúI recommend you to learn about what has been written by prominent scholars on Turkic verb systems.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>And along with this sentence, he sent me a flood of links ‚Äî all of them leading to his own work. Not one relevant comment on the actual content of my paper. Just dismissal and self-promotion disguised as advice.</p>



<h4>So I coined a term:</h4>

<h3>Dirtiot = Dirty + Idiot</h3>

<blockquote>When someone uses the polished image of academic authority to cover the dirt of arrogance, while expecting others to worship the very links that point only to themselves.</blockquote>



<p>This word came from an experience ‚Äî but it belongs to a larger truth.<br>

And I will keep writing.</p>
