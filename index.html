    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è This site once disappeared from Google‚Äôs index.</strong><br><br>
    Not for error. Not for violation. But perhaps for one reason:<br>
    <em>It doesn‚Äôt fit their boxes.</em><br><br>
    Now it‚Äôs back ‚Äî but quieter, harder to find.<br><br>
    If you are here, you didn‚Äôt just search ‚Äî<br>
    you stepped outside the stream. And that already means something.

    One friend once said I ‚Äúlearned a lot in the U.S.‚Äù<br>
    I said yes.<br>
    <em>That was a mistake ‚Äî out of politeness.</em><br><br>
    What I have made ‚Äî these words, these theories, these papers ‚Äî<br>
    came not from America, not from any Western lab,<br>
    but from Iran, from Turkey ‚Äî<br>
    from nights of doubt, days of fire, and decades of silence.<br><br>
    If they didn‚Äôt teach me,<br>
    they have no right to own what I found.<br><br>

<h1>Babak Jabbar Nezhad</h1>

<p>

I‚Äôm a mathematician, philosopher, and independent researcher from Da≈ü Maku, West Azerbaijan.<br>

My work spans mathematical logic, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and cosmology ‚Äî with a critical focus on structural truth beyond conventional academic frameworks.<br>

I‚Äôve published 24 research papers, several of which introduce original logical frameworks (such as the Parallel Law of Excluded Middle), linguistic reconstructions in Azerbaijani, and new models of emotional intelligence.<br>

I also write poetry in Azerbaijani, English, French, and Turkish, blending structure with inner voice.

<h2>üîç Critiques & Coined Words</h2>

<h3>The Story Behind the Word ‚ÄúDirtiot‚Äù</h3>

<p><em>(Dirty + Idiot ‚Äî but in silence, not insult)</em></p>



<p>A few months ago, I submitted my paper ‚ÄúExploring Azerbaijani Verb Conjugation: A Comparative Study with French and English‚Äù to the Journal of Turkic Languages, accompanied by a respectful letter explaining my comparative methodology and the paper‚Äôs focus on filling grammatical gaps in Azerbaijani through logic and systematization.</p>



<p>Less than 24 hours later, I received this response from Prof. Dr. Lars Johanson:</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúYour approach is personal as you point out. As such it has definitely a value for you, but it cannot be published in our journal‚Ä¶ I send you here a link to an article on the Maku dialect.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>He dismissed the core of the work‚Äîits comparative logic, grammatical contributions, and structural insights‚Äîreducing it to a personal reflection. I replied respectfully, clarifying that my paper was grounded in analytical reasoning, not anecdotal memory, and that the goal was to enrich linguistic theory, not merely reflect on dialects.</p>



<p>His final reply?</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúI recommend you to learn about what has been written by prominent scholars on Turkic verb systems.‚Äù</blockquote>



<p>And along with this sentence, he sent me a flood of links ‚Äî all of them leading to his own work. Not one relevant comment on the actual content of my paper. Just dismissal and self-promotion disguised as advice.</p>



<h4>So I coined a term:</h4>

<h3>Dirtiot = Dirty + Idiot</h3>

<blockquote>When someone uses the polished image of academic authority to cover the dirt of arrogance, while expecting others to worship the very links that point only to themselves.</blockquote>



<p>This word came from an experience ‚Äî but it belongs to a larger truth.<br>

And I will keep writing.</p>
