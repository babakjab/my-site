    <h2>Ukraine: Between History, Reality, and a Way Forward</h2>



    <p>Ukraine today is a victim of a prolonged conflict between the West and Russia. Its tragedy is not only the ongoing war but also the weight of history and divided loyalties.</p>



    <h3>A Divided Past</h3>

    <p>During the Second World War, Ukraine became a land of fracture. Some Ukrainians supported Nazi Germany, hoping it might bring independence from Soviet rule. Others fought bravely in the Red Army and partisan movements against the Nazis. This duality left behind a nation both scarred and divided, where loyalty was never uniform but always contested.</p>



    <h3>The Question of Independence and Realism</h3>

    <p>Every nation, including Ukraine, has the right to independence. But independence also raises a deeper question: <em>at what cost, and with what realism?</em></p>



    <p>Ukraine is home not only to Ukrainians but also to Russians, especially in the east and Crimea. Historically, Crimea belonged to the Russian Empire. It passed to the Soviet Union, then in 1954, under <strong>Nikita Khrushchev</strong>, it was transferred to Ukraine—more as a political gesture within the USSR than as a matter of identity or autonomy.</p>



    <h3>The Turning Point</h3>

    <p>In modern times, <strong>Viktor Yanukovych</strong>, a president supported by Moscow, held power until his removal in 2014 during the Euromaidan uprising. Yet even under his leadership, Russia had no direct justification to seize Crimea. But after his fall—backed by Western support—Ukraine’s shift became rapid, aligning itself more with the West and detaching sharply from Russia.</p>



    <p>Russia then moved: Crimea was invaded and annexed in 2014. Later, in 2022, the full-scale war began, justified by Moscow as a response to Ukraine’s possible NATO membership. While NATO expansion was portrayed by the West as Ukraine’s sovereign choice, for Russia it was the <em>red line</em>.</p>



    <h3>The Reality of Ukraine as a Tool</h3>

    <p>In truth, Ukraine has been trapped between two forces. To Russia, Ukraine is a buffer and a part of its historical sphere. To the West, Ukraine has been a tool—symbolically championed, militarily supported, but not fully embraced. Western leaders raised the flag of NATO, yet now—years into war—they suggest alternative frameworks, leaving Ukraine both bloodied and uncertain.</p>



    <h3>What Could Be a Solution?</h3>

    <p>The hard reality is that peace will require compromises no side wishes to admit:</p>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Crimea</strong> should be formally recognized as Russian territory. This reflects the reality on the ground and its historical ties.</li>

      <li><strong>NATO membership</strong> must be off the table for Ukraine. This is Russia’s ultimate red line.</li>

      <li><strong>Autonomy</strong> should be granted to Russian-majority regions of eastern Ukraine within Ukrainian sovereignty, as a way to defuse ethnic and political tensions.</li>

      <li>In return, <strong>Russia must withdraw</strong> from other occupied territories, with Western pressure ensuring compliance.</li>

    </ul>



    <p>This solution is neither ideal nor just for every side, but it is <em>realistic</em>. Otherwise, the war will only continue—with Ukraine paying the heaviest price, not just through Russian aggression, but also through its role as a pawn in a geopolitical game.</p>
