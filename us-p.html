    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>This essay critiques the American political and educational system through the metaphors of boxes, cages, locks, and toys. While slogans about “closed minds” or “cages” oversimplify reality, the deeper truth is that people are trained from childhood to think within structures that limit growth while disguising themselves as freedom. The two-party system in the United States, fueled by money and guarded by mutual interest, excludes independent voices and reduces society to surface-level conflict. Education reinforces this pattern, prioritizing technology, profit, and shortcuts over logic, philosophy, and depth. Through personal experience as a mathematics instructor and reflections from earlier writings such as The Left Shoe, this essay reveals how corruption is not accidental but structural, and how citizens are trained to defend the very boxes that confine them.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>It is easy to dismiss politics as a fight between left and right, Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals. But beneath this spectacle lies a deeper question: why does the fight never change its shape? Why does it always return to the same two poles, the same accusations, the same endless cycle?</p>

    <p>The answer lies not in individual leaders or scandals, but in the structure of the system itself. Politics in the United States is not just influenced by money — it is locked by it. And education, from elementary schools to universities, does not train students to see this structure. Instead, it trains them to accept it, to mistake the box for freedom.</p>

    <p>This essay explores that structure through metaphors — boxes, cages, locks, and toys — and through direct experience. It shows how the system reproduces itself not only in politics but in classrooms, in textbooks, and in culture. The story of American politics is not just about two parties; it is about how an entire society learns to guard its own lock.</p>



    <h2>On Boxes, Cages, and the Illusion of “Closed Minds”</h2>

    <p>People love to say things like “A closed mind is the hardest thing to open” or “Your perspective comes from the cage you were held in.” These are catchy, but they reduce a structural reality into a slogan.</p>

    <p>The truth is deeper. Minds don’t “close” like doors. They are built inside boxes — boxes made of language, culture, habits, and power. A cage isn’t just an obstacle to escape; it’s a whole environment that trains you to mistake its bars for the edges of reality.</p>

    <p>And the real danger is not one party’s voters or another’s, not just “them out there.” The danger is that people across the spectrum confirm whatever their box feeds them — left, right, or center — without ever questioning the box itself. A Democrat who nods along blindly is no freer than a Republican who clings to slogans. Entitlement and corruption live inside every cage that goes unchallenged.</p>

    <p>The problem isn’t the key. The problem is the illusion that you were never in a box at all.</p>

    <h2>Two Parties, No Breath</h2>

    <p>The story of Democrats and Republicans in the U.S. honestly makes me laugh. Each side spends its energy accusing the other, yet neither truly challenges the other in any meaningful, structural way.</p>

    <p>So I ask: where is the lost structure in American history? The answer seems obvious — corruption. Both parties choke off space for smaller or independent voices. They don’t even allow another party to take a short breath. Why? Because of money. Money drowns both of them, and money convinces them it’s in their best interest never to let independent voices exist.</p>

    <p>And so I wonder: is there really no other shadow for the American people than these two parties? Why is the identity of the majority of Americans so tied to the identity of two poles that refuse to grow, that refuse to be challenged?</p>

    <p>A society that limits itself to two poles will, in the end, split into those poles — and perhaps destroy itself. The early signs of that division are already visible in the United States today.</p>

    <p>If corruption and exclusion are the lost structure in American history, then the real question becomes: what could a new structure look like?</p>

    <p>Perhaps it is not about a single “third party,” but about allowing genuine plurality — many voices breathing together instead of suffocating in the shadow of two. A system where independents can exist without being crushed by money, where identity is not chained to two poles, where disagreement doesn’t have to mean destruction.</p>

    <p>The U.S. prides itself on freedom, yet political freedom is narrowed to two camps that refuse to grow. Maybe the true act of freedom is not choosing between blue and red, but stepping outside that box altogether.</p>



    <hr class="sep">



    <h2>The Lock They Guard</h2>

    <p>We often hear that money has corrupted politics in America. But the problem is not only the money itself — it is the lock that keeps every independent voice outside. And who guards that lock? Both major parties.</p>

    <p>Republicans and Democrats accuse each other endlessly, yet they quietly agree on one thing: no one else should be allowed to breathe. They guard the lock together, because keeping it closed serves them both.</p>

    <p>This is why corruption isn’t just an accident of politics — it’s the very structure of the two-party system. When identity is reduced to two poles, each guarded by money, society itself becomes boxed in. No growth, no challenge, no real freedom.</p>

    <p>The question is simple: how long can a nation survive when its future is locked away — and both parties hold the key?</p>



    <hr class="sep">



    <h2>Toys of the System</h2>

    <p>Sometimes American politics looks like children throwing toys back and forth. Democrats accuse Republicans, Republicans accuse Democrats, and people join in — tossing the same toys endlessly, thinking they are free because they can throw something. They don’t see that the toys themselves were handed to them by the system. In truth, they are not players; they are toys of the two poles.</p>

    <p>The fight remains on the surface. Politicians accuse each other. People accuse each other. But all of this hides the deeper truth: the system itself, built by two parties that block every independent voice. And when someone dares to go deeper, the system silences them.</p>

    <p>I wrote about this more than a decade ago in The Left Shoe. In that story, two shoes argue in a shop window. The right shoe says: “I have freedom here, I have comfort.” The left shoe asks: “But can you choose your future?” The right shoe answers: “No. But I don’t care — I have everything I need.” That is how a system trains people to defend their box, even when they have no freedom to choose.</p>

    <p>This is the tragedy of American politics: two poles, no depth. Endless throwing of words on the surface, while the lock on the system stays guarded.</p>



    <hr class="sep">



    <h2>The Unwritten Policy: How America Guards Its Lock</h2>

    <p>On the surface, Democrats and Republicans appear to be locked in endless battle. Each side accuses the other, each side claims moral superiority. But beneath this spectacle, both parties quietly agree on one thing: no other voice should be allowed to breathe. Together, they guard the lock of American politics.</p>

    <p>The lock is not held by one hand. It is a network of forces:</p>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Money and lobbying.</strong> Corporations, donors, and PACs finance both sides, ensuring neither strays far from the same interests.</li>

      <li><strong>The two-party duopoly.</strong> Election laws, debate rules, and ballot restrictions suffocate third parties before they can take shape.</li>

      <li><strong>The revolving door.</strong> Politicians, staffers, and lobbyists cycle between government and private industry, serving the same class.</li>

      <li><strong>Media narratives.</strong> Major networks profit from the “red vs. blue” show and keep the public trapped in the illusion of choice.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>And perhaps most powerful of all: education.</p>

    <p>From elementary school onward, children are taught not to think deeply but to function inside the box. Philosophy, literature, and true art are dismissed as “useless.” Value is measured in money alone: if art doesn’t sell, it doesn’t matter; if philosophy doesn’t generate income, it is ridiculed. I once heard a student joke in Arkansas: “Philosophy majors just masturbate.” In a society that mocks philosophy, superficial pride replaces depth.</p>

    <p>Even mathematics — which should train logic — is stripped of its real purpose. Instead of teaching students to calculate by hand, schools train them to use calculators. The message: “Technology exists, so let the machine think for you.” What is lost is not only skill, but logic itself — the quiet habit of distinguishing truth from error. This is why American students show strength in geometry (where calculators cannot help), yet struggle in areas where machines give easy answers.</p>

    <p>By high school, students are told they can freely choose their subjects — even to skip mathematics altogether. This “freedom” is a financial strategy for schools to attract more students. The price of this false freedom is the erosion of logic, discipline, and philosophical depth.</p>

    <p>At the university level, the pattern is perfected. Educational software such as ALEKS is marketed as “advanced technology in education,” but in reality it reduces learning to tricks for passing automated tests. Schools adopt these systems because they are profitable, not because they teach.</p>

    <p>I saw the truth of this firsthand while teaching calculus at the University of Arkansas. The standard textbooks presented a shortcut for evaluating limits of rational functions as x \to \infty. The method worked for simple cases but gave wrong answers in more complex ones. When I raised this in a meeting of calculus instructors, the coordinator admitted: “We don’t teach those cases to students.” But those are the very cases students will need in real mathematics and engineering. Complexity was hidden on purpose. The system did not fail by accident — it chose to simplify, to flatten, to keep students in the box.</p>

    <p>This is the unwritten policy of America: money above truth, surface above depth, illusion above structure. The political system locks out new voices; the educational system trains children not to notice. By the time they are adults, most Americans already believe that worth = income, that art must sell to matter, that philosophy is a waste, and that politics has only two poles.</p>

    <p>The tragedy is not just that people are trapped in the box. It is that they are trained to defend the box as if it were freedom. And when someone dares to go deeper, to challenge the lock itself, the system silences them.</p>

    <p>So the question remains: how long can a nation survive when its future is locked away, its citizens taught to guard the lock, and its very education designed to mistake the box for freedom?</p>



    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The United States prides itself on freedom, yet it has narrowed political freedom to two poles that refuse to grow. It calls its education “advanced,” yet it trains students to bypass logic in favor of shortcuts, profit, and shallow success. The lock on the system is not just political; it is cultural, educational, and philosophical.</p>

    <p>And yet, the possibility of freedom remains. To see it requires looking beyond the toys thrown back and forth, beyond the slogans of “cages” and “closed minds.” It requires questioning the very box that most people have been trained to defend.</p>

    <p>The tragedy of America is not that it lacks intelligence or energy. It is that its people are trained to mistake their confinement for choice, their box for freedom. How long can a nation survive under such an illusion? The answer will depend on whether enough people can step outside — not just of their party, but of the structure itself.</p>



    <h2>Acknowledgment</h2>

    <p>The reflections in this essay did not appear overnight. They are the result of years of teaching, writing, and observing the structures that shape human thought. From my time teaching calculus at the University of Arkansas, where I saw how even mathematics was simplified to hide complexity, to my earlier writings such as The Left Shoe (written more than a decade ago), I have returned again and again to the question of how systems confine us.</p>

    <p>This essay stands on those experiences. It was shaped in dialogue, sharpened in contrast with the shallow slogans I have often encountered, and written with the belief that philosophy and structural thinking still matter in a world that too often dismisses them.</p>
